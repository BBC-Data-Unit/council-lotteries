In July 2020 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-53435016) on fears over lotteries with jackpots of up to £25,000 being run by local authorities in a bid to raise funds for cultural activities and events in the wake of coronavirus.

People providing addiction support services questioned whether councils were providing a "gateway to gambling".
